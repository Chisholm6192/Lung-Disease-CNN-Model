This is an AI model which will tell the user whether a given lung x-ray represnets Normal lungs or lungs which represent Viral Pneumnoia
The three pre trained models represent the base we built off of, and the interface is used as a web app to allow users to use our pediction model, and the CNN model is the actual prediciton model itself
